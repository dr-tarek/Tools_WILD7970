One of the most disruptive papers in the field of poultry science, particularly related to broiler welfare and behavior, is " The effect of light intensity on the behavior, eye and leg health, and immune function of broiler chickens" by Blatchford et al. This study was instrumental in linking lighting intensity with broiler welfare indicators such as leg health, walking ability (gait score), and activity levels. It showed that low light intensity can reduce activity, which in turn affects leg strength and increases the risk of leg disorders, thus impacting overall welfare. This research shifted the industry's focus toward light management as a critical welfare factor, making it disruptive.

In the past 5-10 years, one of the most disruptive papers is "Comparison of Two LED Light Bulbs to a Dimmable CFL and their Effects on Broiler Chicken Growth, Stress, and Fear"by Archer et al. This study introduced LED lighting as a welfare-friendly, energy-efficient alternative to traditional incandescent or fluorescent lighting systems used in poultry houses. The paper demonstrated that LED lighting could be tailored to meet the physiological and behavioral needs of broilers, significantly improving welfare indicators such as latency to lie, footpad health, and fear response, while maintaining optimal growth rates. This study shifted the industry's understanding of lighting from a simple utility for visibility and growth to a multifaceted tool that can optimize animal welfare without sacrificing productivity.

Yes, the disruptive or paradigm-shifting nature of research in poultry welfare and lighting has somewhat declined in recent years. While innovative studies like those exploring the effects of LED lights continue to push the boundaries of knowledge, the field has increasingly seen incremental improvements rather than fundamental shifts. One possible reason for this is that a significant portion of the foundational knowledge in broiler welfare and lighting has already been established. Researchers are now fine-tuning aspects of previous discoveries, such as adjusting light intensity, wavelength, or duration, rather than introducing completely novel ideas. Additionally, the increased focus on practical, industry-driven solutions could be limiting more groundbreaking research.

Scientific computing has become an indispensable tool in the field of poultry science, offering a wide range of applications for data analysis, management, visualization, and communication. With the increasing complexity of modern research and the need for large-scale data handling, the integration of computing tools has transformed how we conduct experiments, analyze outcomes, and present findings. These tools have revolutionized our ability to understand intricate phenomena such as animal behavior, welfare, disease transmission, and even the genetic underpinnings of poultry health.

In poultry science, program such as R is frequently employed for data analysis. This statistical software package allows researchers to perform complex calculations and manage large datasets efficiently, from evaluating welfare indicators to analyzing the impact of environmental factors on poultry behavior. R, in particular, is widely favored for its versatility in statistical modeling and data visualization, making it an essential tool for visualizing patterns and trends in behavioral or welfare data.

One application I have found particularly valuable in my research is BORIS, a free software for behavioral observation. This app allows me to track the behavior of chickens in real-time, coding specific behaviors and generating detailed logs of these activities. Using BORIS has streamlined the data collection process for my research on poultry welfare, enabling me to collect precise behavioral data that can be integrated into statistical analyses using R or SAS. The ability to create custom ethograms (behavior categories) and easily export the data makes BORIS a vital tool for understanding complex behavioral patterns in poultry.

One notable challenge in using these tools is the steep learning curve they present. Program like R, while powerful, require users to have a strong understanding of programming and statistical techniques. For many researchers coming from a biological sciences background, acquiring the necessary computational skills can be daunting and time-consuming. Moreover, managing large datasets and ensuring data accuracy can also be a significant hurdle. As poultry science research often involves behavioral observations and welfare measurements, ensuring the integrity of such data during analysis is crucial. Mismanagement can lead to misleading results and conclusions, which can have far-reaching consequences for welfare standards or disease control strategies.

In conclusion, scientific computing plays a vital role in advancing research in poultry science, offering powerful tools for data analysis, visualization, and communication. While challenges such as steep learning curves and data management persist, continued advancements in computational techniques will further enhance the ability to tackle complex questions in this field. By embracing these tools, researchers can contribute to more informed decision-making in poultry health, welfare, and productivity.

When receiving feedback from reviewers that I disagree with or that conflicts with other feedback, it's important for me to handle the situation carefully and thoughtfully. First, I would take time to thoroughly review each comment to understand the concerns raised. Even if I disagree, I try to see if the feedback points out areas in my work that could be clarified, supported with more evidence, or improved in some way.

If I still believe that certain suggestions are not necessary after careful consideration, I would address them respectfully in my response to the reviewers. I would clearly explain why I think the suggested changes may not be appropriate for my study, backing up my reasoning with evidence from my research or relevant literature. When faced with contradictory feedback from different reviewers, I would acknowledge the differences and explain how I decided to address them. For example, if two reviewers give conflicting advice, I would explain why I chose to follow one recommendation over the other, making sure my explanation is clear and well-supported.

Predatory journals pose a significant threat to the integrity of scientific research by undermining the credibility of science as a whole. These journals often bypass rigorous peer review processes, allowing poorly conducted or even fraudulent studies to be published. This erosion of quality control can lead to the propagation of erroneous information when such articles are cited by other researchers or used as references in policy-making. As a result, the trust that both the scientific community and the public place in published research is weakened.

Public perception of science is heavily influenced by the media and the accessibility of scientific information. Predatory journals, which prioritize profit over quality, contribute to the dissemination of flawed research. When the public encounters contradictory or poorly supported scientific claims---especially those published in journals that appear legitimate---they may become confused or mistrustful of science. This is particularly dangerous in today's climate of growing skepticism toward scientific consensus, where misinformation can easily spread and fuel doubt about legitimate scientific efforts.

Misinformation is a major consequence of predatory publishing. Studies published in predatory journals often lack proper methodology, making their findings unreliable. These articles can be picked up by the media, shared on social networks, and cited in other works, contributing to the spread of false or misleading information. This is particularly harmful in critical areas such as public health, climate science, and environmental policies, where misinformation can lead to poor decision-making and societal harm.

In the field of poultry science, particularly regarding Bacterial Chondronecrosis with Osteomyelitis (BCO), predatory journals pose a unique threat. For example, if a study on a new treatment for BCO is published in a predatory journal without proper peer review, the findings might be inaccurate or overstate the treatment's effectiveness. If these results are disseminated widely, they could lead to a false sense of security among poultry farmers, potentially resulting in inadequate management practices. This not only jeopardizes the poultry industry but also the welfare of the animals, as untreated BCO can lead to severe lameness and economic losses. Furthermore, if such flawed studies influence industry practices or regulations, the resulting spread of misinformation could undermine efforts to effectively manage BCO in broiler production. In a broader sense, the public, already influenced by rising doubts about scientific integrity, may become more skeptical of legitimate BCO research if they perceive that the science is inconsistent or unreliable.

In conclusion, predatory journals have far-reaching implications beyond just the academic community. They erode scientific credibility, distort public perception, and contribute to the dangerous spread of misinformation. Addressing the challenges posed by these journals is critical in maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of scientific research, especially in fields like poultry science where animal welfare and industry standards are directly impacted.

As a collaborator of Dr. Andrews, I would approach her authorship request with respect, while also emphasizing the importance of adhering to ethical authorship standards. Dr. Andrews' role in developing the research concept and securing the necessary funding was critical, and her contributions to the early stages of the project are highly valued. However, in academic publishing, authorship is generally granted based on ongoing and substantial involvement in the research process, data analysis, or manuscript preparation. Since Dr. Andrews had limited engagement with the project after the grant was secured, it may not be appropriate for her to expect authorship on every paper.

I would express my appreciation for Dr. Andrews' pivotal role in the project, while explaining that academic authorship is typically reserved for those who make direct contributions to the research or the writing of each paper. Although her role in launching the project was essential, it may not warrant inclusion as an author on all publications resulting from the research. A more balanced approach would be to include Dr. Andrews as an author on papers where her intellectual contributions were more substantial, especially those closely aligned with her original ideas. However, for publications where Dr. Andrews had a more limited role, I would recommend acknowledging her contributions in securing the grant and providing guidance throughout the project.

People often think statistics can be twisted to show anything, but in reality, good statistical work is all about being accurate and honest with data. In my project, I chose methods that directly answer my research questions, making sure the results show real patterns instead of random trends. I also took steps to minimize bias and check assumptions, so the findings truly add to our understanding, rather than just telling a story with numbers.

While some might misuse statistics, responsible research uses these tools to uncover real insights. I carefully documented each step, looked for any limitations, and selected analyses that avoid exaggerating or distorting the results. This makes my conclusions more reliable, giving a clear, honest picture of the data. When done right, statistics help simplify complex information, making them essential for drawing solid, evidence-based conclusions.

A citizen science project in poultry welfare could involve enlisting volunteers to help monitor and improve housing conditions for broilers by examining behavioral and health indicators. The primary goal would be to assess how specific environmental factors, such as lighting, affect bird welfare, particularly their comfort levels and stress responses. Volunteers could help by observing broiler behaviors, such as activity levels, feather pecking, and use of resting areas, while also recording health markers like the incidence of footpad dermatitis or signs of respiratory issues. This data would be instrumental in understanding how minor adjustments in housing can lead to significant welfare improvements.

The benefits of this citizen science approach are substantial. By involving community members, researchers can expand data collection efforts across a wider number of facilities, gathering more comprehensive data than would be possible with a limited research team. Engaging citizens also raises awareness about poultry welfare, encouraging informed discussions on ethical farming practices. Volunteers bring diverse perspectives, which could inspire innovative approaches to data collection and welfare improvements, fostering a collaborative environment for scientific inquiry.

However, several challenges may arise. Ensuring data quality is a key concern, as volunteers may lack the technical expertise needed for accurate observation and recording. To address this, training sessions and consistent guidance would be essential. Maintaining participant engagement over time, especially if the tasks become repetitive, poses another challenge, as does managing logistics, such as coordinating data collection schedules and standardizing data entry. With careful planning and oversight, these obstacles can be minimized, allowing citizen scientists to make a meaningful contribution to poultry welfare research.
